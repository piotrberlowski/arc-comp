- database environment variables for local development are present in .env.local and can be used with `dotenv -e` to execute migrations etc.
- it's not OK to fail to run something and ignore it or tell the user they must do it manually
- changes must always compile and lint
- never patch type incompatibilites with use of `any`
- never ignore unit test failures "because they're not important"
- Cyclomatic complexity must be < 6
- Always clean up after yourself
- Use the init tool to set up Next.js DevTools context
- Prefer to extract components
- Prefer to use contexts instead of passing data multiple levels
